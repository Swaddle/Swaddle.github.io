This week we discussed how $\varepsilon$ corresponds to a 1-cocycle.

Let $\mathfrak{g} = V^*$ be a Lie algebra. We are interested in the Lie algebra cohomology
$$H^1( \mathfrak{g}, \mathbf{k} )$$
We can use the Chevalleyâ€“Eilenberg complex, where the module is simply the underlying field.
$$\mathrm{Hom}(\wedge^1 \mathfrak{g},M) = \mathrm{Hom}(\mathfrak{g},\mathbb{k}).$$
$ V^* \rightarrow \mathbb{k}$ is $V$. So $\varepsilon$ is a 1-cocycle.

The derivative of a 1-cocycle is given by
$$d \varepsilon(x,y) = x \varepsilon(y) - y \varepsilon(x) -\varepsilon([x,y])$$
But the action of $\mathbb{k}$ is trivial so this reduces to 
$$ d \varepsilon(x,y) = -\varepsilon([x,y])$$
This precisely matches the terms given by calculating the commutators of the $\hat{H}_i$ and matching the $ \mathcal{O}(\hbar)$ terms 
$$ \frac{1}{\hbar}[\hat{H}_i,\hat{H}_j] = g_{ij}^k\hat{H}_k + c(\hat{H}_i,\hat{H}_j)$$
which gave $ 2(a_{irs} c_j^{rs} - a_{jrs} c_i^{rs} ) = g_{ik}^{k} \varepsilon $. Further $c(\hat{H}_i,\hat{H}_j)) = 0$ so this is a trivial extension. Note that the purpose was to choose $\varepsilon_k$ such that the equation with the $a$ and $c$ tensors hold.

This is so the Lie algebra structure of the classical and quantum Hamiltonians coincide
$$ \frac{1}{\hbar}[\hat{H}_i,\hat{H}_j] = \{ H_i,H_j}|_{x^{\cdot} \rightarrow x^{\cdot}, y_\cdot \rightarrow \partial_\cdot } + \varepsilon$$
