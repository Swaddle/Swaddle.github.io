                Quantum computation is a paradigm that uses quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computational tasks. With an optimal algorithm, a quantum computer would be able to perform cer- tain tasks more efficiently than a classical computer. Any quantum algorithm can be implemented physically by a quantum circuit that is composed from a basic set of instructions. These instructions are mathematically represented as matrices.

                A topic of significance is how to design a particular quantum operation efficiently out of a basic set of instructions. To this end we use the notion of geodesics in Lie groups. In this situation, a geodesic is a continuous sequence of instructions that needs to be performed in order to give the least complex quantum circuit. The allowed steps in the sequence come from an instruction set, which is represented by elements of a Lie group. Certain operations however are restricted by a physical cost, which is built into the equations governing the geodesics.

                Explicitly finding these geodesics requires solving a multi dimensional boundary value problem for two coupled ordinary differential equations. Once found these geodesics can be discretized into discrete operations.
